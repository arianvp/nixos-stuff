        <h1 class="post-title">Why functional programming?</h1>

        <section class="post-content">
            <p>As developers we want to write robust and correct code. This is our ultimate goal.</p>

<p>To reach this goal, we write tests that assure us of the correct behaviour of our code.</p>

<p>To make code testable, we define code in isolated units, that are also tested in isolation.</p>

<p>Dependencies between units should soley be described through dependency injection.  A unit describes on what units it depends.   If unit C depends on unit A and B, and A and B are tested to function correctly, then if we test unit C then we can be assured that A and B won't cause tests to fail suddenly as we know how A and B behave.  This way of thinking is what we call unit testing and is one of the most important parts of Test Driven Development.</p>

<p>So what if we would limit a language to only be able to define units that can only depend on behaviour of well-functioning other units? So that it's output (its behaviour) is soley dependend on its input?</p>

<p>Well in mathematics we have a concept called functions. Here have one $ f(x) = 3x$. I'm sure you've used them in high school. Behaviour of functions is fully dependent on its input..  $f(5)$ will always yield $15$.  No matter how many times you call it.  If we compose functions, then one function is dependent on the behaviour of another function.  Say we have $g(x) = x+2$ then  $f(g(x))$ is $f$ with as input the behaviour of $g$. and because we know the behaviour of $g$ is well-defined, we know that $f$ well defned as well.  $f(g(5))$ will always yield $21$, not matter how much you call it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In mathematics, a function is a relation between a set of inputs and a set of permissible outputs with the property that each input is related to exactly one output. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So basically a function is exactly the definition of a unit and nothing more. It encapsulates exactly what we expect a unit to be. And this forms the basis of functional programming.</p>

<p>In functional programming, our programs are soley composed of functions, and nothing else.  And this has a very powerful consequence. It means our code is unit-testable by default, because functions are exactly what makes a unit a unit.</p>

<p>Well-testable and well-tested software is easier to refactor, extend, and to trace back bugs in. This makes functional languages a great tool for robust software with an easy development cycle.</p>
